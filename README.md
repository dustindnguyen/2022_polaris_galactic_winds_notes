# 2022 polaris galactic wind notes
Repository containing Mathematica and Jupyter notebooks for undergraduate mentees Ashley Tarrant and Sierra Reis. Notebooks may contain some typos that we will resolve out when meeting in person. 

Content:
1. `Derivation of CC85 Polaris.nb` is a Mathematica notebook detailing how to derive the CC85 solution. 
2. `03March2022_Polaris_CC85.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook which contains a basic root find (newton-raphson method) for the analytic CC85 solution and numerically integrated results from r>R. The objective is to showcase how the derived analytic solution agrees with the numerical solution.
